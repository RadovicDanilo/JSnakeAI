# 🐍 JSnake AI - Snake Game with AI Agents  

**JSnake AI** is a project featuring multiple AI agents designed to play and master the classic Snake game using different algorithms and strategies.  

---

## 🚀 AI Agents Overview  
### 1. 🌀 Single Hamiltonian Cycle  
- Follows a fixed Hamiltonian path, ensuring the snake never collides with itself.

### 2. ⚡ Hamiltonian Cycle with Shortcuts  
- Similar to the Hamiltonian path but takes shortcuts when possible to reach the food faster.

### 3. 🧭 BFS with Tail Following  
- Uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to ensure the snake can always follow its tail, optimizing movement.
