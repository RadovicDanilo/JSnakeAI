JSnake AI<br>
A collection of AI agents that play the game snake that I created for a university project. <br>
1. SingleHamiltonianCycle<br>
The simplest approach. Snake will follow a set Hamiltonian path which will guarantee that it will not collide with itself.<br>

2. SingleHamiltonianCycleWithShortcuts<br>
Just like the first one but it takes shortcuts when it can<br>

3. BFSWithTailFollowing<br>
Always guarantees that it can follow its tail<br>
